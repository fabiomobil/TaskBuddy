## MANDATORY: NO CODE WITHOUT PERMISSION
**BEFORE using Write, Edit, or MultiEdit tools:**
1. Describe exactly what will be implemented
2. Explain the technical approach and reasoning
3. Ask: "Can I proceed with this implementation?"
4. Wait for explicit user permission
5. Only then write the code

## MANDATORY: NO FILES WITHOUT DISCUSSION
**BEFORE creating ANY new file (Write tool):**
1. Propose the file location, name, and purpose
2. Explain why this file is necessary
3. Describe the file structure and content approach
